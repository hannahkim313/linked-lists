# Linked Lists

## Project Summary
This project, created by The Odin Project, is a mini exercise to practice creating and working with data structures, specifically linked lists. Several functions (with the help from the `Node` factory) are built into the `LinkedList` factory that would provide developers the ability to use linked lists in future projects.
